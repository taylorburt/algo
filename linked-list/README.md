# Reverse Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Example 3:

Input: head = []
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?


# Remove Linked List Element

Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [], val = 1
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 50
0 <= val <= 50
